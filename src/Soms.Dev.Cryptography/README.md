# Cryptography

Soms.Dev.Cryptography is a library designed to simplify the implementation of secure hashing, verification, encryption, and decryption in your applications. It provides robust and easy-to-use APIs to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

## Core Features

-   Hashing and Verification
-   Encryption and Decryption

## Installation

### .NET Core Library

Install the core library via NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package Soms.Dev.Cryptography
```

## Releases

-   **Soms.Dev.Cryptography**: [![NuGet Core](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Soms.Dev.Cryptography.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Soms.Dev.Cryptography)
